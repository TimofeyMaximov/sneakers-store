                    <h2>Off-White “ICA” Nike Air Force 1 Low</h2>
                    <p>The Off-White x Nike Air Force 1 Low ‘Lemonade’ reunites Virgil Abloh with Bruce Kilgore’s iconic 1982 basketball shoe. Abloh dips the leather upper in a rich mustard yellow hue, save for a silver Swoosh outlined in contrast zigzag stitching and the designer’s signature Helvetica text on the medial quarter panel. A matching yellow midsole features ‘AIR’ printed on the lateral sidewall. Exposed foam construction is utilized on the collar and tongue, the latter decorated with a woven tag that displays ‘OFF’ Nike Air branding. Abloh leaves his final mark by looping his signature zip tie around the laces.</p>

                    <h2>Nike SB Dunk Low Grateful Dead Yellow</h2>
                    <p>Developed in collaboration with the iconic San Francisco jam band, the Grateful Dead x Nike Dunk Low SB ‘Yellow Bear’ features a unique design inspired by the back cover of ‘History of the Grateful Dead, Volume One (Bear’s Choice),’ a live album originally released in 1973. A vibrant yellow finish is applied to the furry upper, fortified with tonal suede overlays and mounted atop a matching yellow foam midsole. Contrasting blue hits appear on the jagged Swoosh, rubber outsole and tongue, the latter furnished with a hidden stash pocket.</p>

                    <h2>Off-White “Chicago / OG” Jordan 1 High</h2>
                    <p>Created by designer Virgil Abloh, the Air Jordan 1 x Off-White comes in the classic Chicago colorway. Some of the sneakers' half-finished features include a Swoosh connected to the shoe with visible blue stitching, 'Air' printed on the midsole, and an Off-White zip tie on the collar. The box comes deconstructed as it's been turned inside-out with the inside consisting of a black base and gold Jumpman logo, while the outside is plain cardboard with the words 'Jumpman' printed on it. Virgil's Off-White collection included remixed iterations of the Air VaporMax, Air Presto, Air Max 90, Blazer, Air Max 97, Hyperdunk 2017, Air Force 1, Zoom Fly, and Chuck Taylor.</p>

                    <h2>Dior x Air Jordan 1 High</h2>
                    <p>Bridging the gap between street-ready sportswear and luxury fashion, the Dior x Air Jordan 1 High is drawn from a larger collaboration that spans footwear, apparel and accessories. Designer Kim Jones’ take on the iconic sneaker makes use of a white and grey upper constructed from Italian leather with hand-painted edges. Dual branding hits take the form of a Dior woven tongue tag, a Nike Swoosh in Dior Oblique jacquard, and icy outsoles revealing a Dior and Dior Wings logo on each shoe.</p>
